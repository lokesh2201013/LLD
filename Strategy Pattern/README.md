🧩 What is the Strategy Design Pattern?

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms (behaviors), encapsulates each one as an independent class, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

➡️ It allows the behavior of an object to change dynamically, without altering the object’s class itself.

✅ Advantages of Strategy Pattern
Advantage	Explanation
🧩 Open/Closed Principle	You can add new strategies (behaviors) without modifying existing classes.
🔁 Behavior Reusability	Each behavior (e.g., Walk, Talk, Fly) is reusable and can be composed in different ways.
🧠 Encapsulation of Algorithms	Different algorithms are isolated in their own classes — easier to understand and maintain.
⚙️ Runtime Flexibility	You can switch strategies dynamically during runtime (e.g., robot learns to fly).
🧹 Removes Conditionals	Replaces large if-else or switch-case blocks with polymorphism.
🔄 Better Testing and Extensibility	You can test behaviors independently from the main class.

⚠️ Disadvantages of Strategy Pattern
Disadvantage	Explanation
📦 Increased Number of Classes	Each new behavior requires a new class — can lead to “class explosion.”
🧱 Complexity for Small Projects	Might be overkill for simple logic that can be handled with a few conditionals.
🧩 Client Awareness	The client (e.g., the code using the robot) must be aware of the different strategies to choose the right one.
💬 Dependency Management	You need to manage and inject the right strategies — this may require dependency injection frameworks or factory patterns.
⚙️ No State Sharing	Each strategy is typically stateless — if they need shared context, you must pass it explicitly.
🏗️ When to Use the Strategy Pattern

Use it when:
You have multiple ways of doing something (different algorithms).
You want to switch between those ways dynamically.
You want to avoid large conditional blocks in your main class.
You expect new behaviors to be added in the future (extensibility).
